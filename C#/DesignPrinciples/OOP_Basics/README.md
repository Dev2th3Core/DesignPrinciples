# OOP Basics

This folder contains a concise implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#. It serves as a reference implementation demonstrating core OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access control using properties and access modifiers
- **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes and interfaces
- **Polymorphism**: Both compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding)
- **Inheritance**: Single-level, multi-level, and interface inheritance

For detailed understanding on OOP concepts you can checkout this [oop repository](https://github.com/Rakshit4045/oop)

## Overview

The implementation includes:
- Abstract [`Employee`](./Encap&Abstract&Poly&InheritImpl.cs) base class
- [`PermanentEmployee`](./Encap&Abstract&Poly&InheritImpl.cs) and [`ContractEmployee`](./Encap&Abstract&Poly&InheritImpl.cs) derived classes
- Leave management interfaces and implementation
- Practical examples of employee management and payroll calculations

## Relationship to Other Projects

This folder is part of a larger Design Principles project that focuses on SOLID principles. While the main project explores advanced design principles, this folder contains a streamlined version of a previous Object-Oriented Programming project, serving as:

- A quick reference for OOP concepts
- A foundation for understanding SOLID principles
- A bridge between basic OOP and advanced design patterns

## Running the Demo

The demo can be executed through the [`Program.cs`](./Program.cs) file, which demonstrates various OOP concepts through practical examples of employee management.
