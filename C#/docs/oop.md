# OOP_Basics Folder Overview

The `OOP_Basics` folder contains a practical C# project that demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through real-world employee management scenarios. This project is structured to help learners understand how encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied in a professional context.

## Project Highlights
- **Encapsulation**: Secure data and control access using properties and access modifiers in the `Employee` class hierarchy.
- **Abstraction**: Use of abstract classes and interfaces to define contracts for employee types and leave management.
- **Inheritance**: Implementation of single-level and multi-level inheritance with classes like `PermanentEmployee` and `ContractEmployee`.
- **Polymorphism**: Both compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) polymorphism are demonstrated, including interface-based polymorphism for leave management.

## Structure & Usage
- The main logic is in [`Encap&Abstract&Poly&InheritImpl.cs`](./Encap&Abstract&Poly&InheritImpl.cs), which defines the employee classes and their behaviors.
- The [`Program.cs`](./Program.cs) file serves as the entry point, running a demo that showcases all OOP concepts together.
- The [`Interface/`](./Interface/) folder contains interface definitions for different types of leave, showing how abstraction and polymorphism work in practice.

## How to Explore
- Review the code in `Encap&Abstract&Poly&InheritImpl.cs` to see how OOP principles are implemented.
- Run the project via `Program.cs` to observe encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in action with employee and leave management examples.

This folder is intended as a reference and learning resource for anyone looking to master OOP in C# before moving on to advanced design principles.
