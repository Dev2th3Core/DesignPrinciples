# Design Principles in C# - A Practical Guide

This project is a continuation of the beginner's [OOP](https://github.com/Rakshit4045/oop) project, focusing on learning and applying key software design principles in C#. It builds on foundational OOP concepts and introduces best practices for writing maintainable, scalable, and robust code. The project takes a step-by-step approach, starting from basic concepts and gradually building up to more complex implementations.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates core design principles (SOLID Principle) through practical C# examples. Each principle is explained with clear code samples and real-world scenarios to help you understand not just the theory, but also how to apply these principles in your own projects.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this design principles project, you should have:
- Completed or understood the basics from the OOP learning project
- Familiarity with:
  - C# syntax and language fundamentals
  - Core OOP concepts (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism)
  - Using Visual Studio or VS Code for C# development

If you need a refresher on OOP, check out the [Object-Oriented Programming in C# - A Beginner's Guide](https://github.com/Rakshit4045/oop?tab=readme-ov-file#object-oriented-programming-oop-learning-project) or the [official C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).
