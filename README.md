# Design Principles Learning Project

> **Note:** This repository specifically focuses on the SOLID principles, which are a subset of software design principles. While there are many design principles in software engineering, this project is dedicated to providing practical examples and documentation for the SOLID principles only.

This project is a continuation of [oop](https://github.com/Rakshit4045/oop) projects. If you havenâ€™t explored it yet, be sure to check it out. It is a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing SOLID Principles concepts across multiple programming languages.

## What are SOLID Principles?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five key object-oriented design principles that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software:
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles are widely regarded as best practices for designing robust and extensible object-oriented systems.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Provide clear, practical, and modern examples of SOLID principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) in various languages.
- **Audience:** Beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand and apply SOLID principles in real-world scenarios.

## Supported Languages
- **C#** (current):
  - Step-by-step documentation, code walkthroughs, and practice exercises.
  - See the [`C#`](./C%23) folder for all C#-related docs and code.
- **Other Languages:**
  - Support for additional languages (such as Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.) is planned for the future.
  - Each language will have its own top-level folder (e.g., `Java/`, `Python/`).

## How to Navigate
- Go to the folder for your preferred language (currently only `C#` is available).
- Inside each language folder, you'll find:
  - `docs/` - Guided documentation and learning path
  - `DesignPrinciples/` - Code implementations for each Design Principle concept

## Contributing
We welcome contributions in any language!
- To add a new language, create a new folder at the root (e.g., `Java/`, `Python/`).
- Follow the structure used in the `C#` folder for documentation and code organization.
- See the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Roadmap
- [x] C# Design Principle documentation and code
- [ ] Add support for Java
- [ ] Add support for Python
- [ ] Add support for JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Community contributions for other languages
